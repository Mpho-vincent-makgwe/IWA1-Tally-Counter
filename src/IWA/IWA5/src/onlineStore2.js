// The changes I made to the code include:

// Changed location from an array to a string.
// Changed BANNED_WARNIN to BANNED_WARNING.
// Changed NONE_SELECTED from a number to a string.
// Fixed the if statement that sets the shipping and currency variables for location === 'RSA' (changed === to =).
// Changed the value of batteries to 35 * 2 to match the output of R70.
// Fixed the condition in the if statement that checks for free shipping (changed && to ||).
// Fixed the condition in the if statement that checks for banned shipping (changed ? to :).
